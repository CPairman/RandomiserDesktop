Version 1.0.0

Randomiser allows you to generate random numbers, simulate dice rolls, shuffle lists, and choose random items from a list.

RANDOM NUMBER
On the 'Random Number' tab, you can generate up to 100 random numbers within a range. You can set your range anywhere between -10,000,000 and 10,000,000; the upper-bound and lower-bound values of your range are both inclusive.
If you check the ‘Allow duplicate numbers’ option, the program may return duplicate numbers. Without this option checked, the program will only return unique numbers.

ROLL DICE
On the ‘Roll Dice’ tab you can simulate rolling up to 100 dice. You can choose which kind of dice to roll, ranging from 4-sided dice, up to 20-sided dice.
If you choose to roll two 10-sided dice, you will see the option ‘Roll for percentage’ become available. With this option checked, the program will roll two 10-sided dice with numbers 0-9 on them, instead of the standard 1-10. The two results will be concatenated into a percentage, e.g a 5 and a 6 becomes 56%. A 0 and a 0 will become 100%.

RANDOMISE LIST
On the ‘Randomise List’ tab, you can enter a list of up to 10,000 items, and the program will shuffle the list into a random order.

RANDOM ITEM
On the ‘Random Item’ tab, you can enter a list of up to 10,000 items, and program will select up to 100 items from the list at random. 
If you check the ‘Allow duplicate items’ option, the program may return duplicates of an item. Without this option checked, the program will only return an item once.
